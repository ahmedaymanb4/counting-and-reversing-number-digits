# counting and reversing number digits
Program main() function should read an integer and calls a function that:

(1) counts the total digits of this number, and

(2) outputs the number with its digits reversed.

For example, when n=152, digits = 3, and digits reversed = 251.

Psuedo code:

//program starts

//reads an integer

//divide that integer by d=10

//stop division when (n==0) becomes true

//calculate the total times this number divided (if n=552,count=3)
